The application was part of the final project stage of the SoyHenry bootcamp, with a duration of one month and in which we collaborated a total of 8 people using agile SCRUM methodologies. For the project we mainly used the TypeScript programming language, making use of technologies such as React, Redux and Material UI for the front-end, and technologies for the back-end such as Express, NodeJs, the ORM Sequelize along with the PostgreSQL DB management system. In its development I participated mainly in the back-end implementation, tasks such as the creation of models and their relationships, TypeScript compiler configuration, CRUD management in general for users and administrators, and error and exception handling from the back-end.
